How to run the project locally

Clone repository (git clone ...)

How to add to the repository
Create a new branch (Good practice is letting the branch name contian your own name).
Create a new folder named your own name (This is where you will add all of your .Net code) if you do not already have one in the repo.
Feel free to add Dependancy Injections to the website, but do not interfere with the rest of the club members code/pages.
Have fun! Figure out the blazor app and what you can do with it! We will be putting your code on the navigation bar after we aprove your pull request.
Tips:
Put your images you want to display in the www.root folder.
This repository is made to create a learning enviorment. Although I cannot always catch copied code, I don't want you to create something that isn't yours and call it your own.
If your code does not compile or stops the rest of the website to crash, it will not be added to our main program.
After it is added, show it to your friends and family! This website is meant to show off your personal projects!

Constraints
Be appropriate, we will not be allowing anything on main if we do not find it appropriate for our Snow College Club.
This repo is made for Snow College Students and others affiliated with it. 
Please only do not work on the other students files, nor interfeir with their dependancies outside of their files.
