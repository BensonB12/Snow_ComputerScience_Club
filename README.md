      <li>This repository is made to create a learning enviorment. Although I cannot always catch copied code, I don't want you to create something that isn't yours and call it your own.</li>
      <li>If your code does not compile or stops the rest of the website to crash, it will not be added to our main program.</li>
      <li>After it is added, show it to your friends and family! This website is meant to show off your personal projects!</li>
